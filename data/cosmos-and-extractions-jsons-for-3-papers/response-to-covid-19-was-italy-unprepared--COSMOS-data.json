Between then and the total lockdown introduced on 22nd March 2020 Italy was hit by an unprecedented crisis. In add- ition to being the first European country to be heavily swept by the COVID-19 pandemic, Italy was the first to introduce stringent lockdown measures. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and related COVID-19 pan- demic have been the worst public health challenge endured in recent history by Italy. Two months since the beginning of the first wave, the estimated excess deaths in Lombardy, the hardest hit region in the country, reached a peak of more than 23,000 deaths. The extraordinary pressures exerted on the Italian Servizio Sanitario Nazionale (SSN) inevitably leads to questions about its preparedness and the appropri- ateness and effectiveness of responses implemented at both national and regional levels. The aim of the paper is to critically review the Italian response to the COVID-19 crisis spanning from the first early acute phases of the emergency (March\u2013May 2020) to the relative stability of the epidemiological situation just before the second outbreak in October 2020.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9927814603, "detect_cls": "Section Header", "detect_score": -5.3423695564}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 1, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_1_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [117.0, 1247.0, 675.0, 1268.0], "classes": ["Page Footer", "Page Header", "Other", "Reference text", "Figure", "Figure Caption", "Equation", "Table", "Section Header", "Body Text", "Abstract", "Equation label", "Table Caption", "Table Note"], "scores": [-5.4803504944, -8.054813385, -9.3114404678, -9.4405345917, -9.7276515961, -9.9139003754, -10.7165317535, -11.3468570709, -11.587428093, -12.4011907578, -13.976442337, -14.4817295074, -14.8326854706, -15.4322805405], "content": "Key words: Health policy; COVID-19; National response; Italy", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.724463582, "detect_cls": "Page Footer", "detect_score": -5.4803504944}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 1, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_1_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [118.0, 1350.0, 305.0, 1371.0], "classes": ["Other", "Section Header", "Body Text", "Figure", "Equation", "Table", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Page Header", "Reference text", "Table Caption", "Abstract", "Table Note", "Figure Caption"], "scores": [-5.1206946373, -6.2302765846, -7.0778779984, -7.1925048828, -7.8601212502, -8.7127418518, -9.3496704102, -9.4865293503, -10.0989341736, -10.3078985214, -10.9275512695, -11.0851364136, -11.2704381943, -12.5417041779], "content": "1.

The SSN is mostly financed through general taxation. In 2019, public health care expenditure was 74% of total health care expenditure (THE) and 6.5% of GDP. Private out-of-pocket payments account for 23% of THE, one of the highest in Europe, with the remainder coming from private health insurance. THE was 8.8% of GDP, in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average, but almost 1% below the European Union (EU) (28) average and lower than most Western European countries; per capita spending was 3649 USD-PPP, 14% lower than the OECD average (Citoni et al., 2020). Unlike other centrally managed national health care systems, the SSN has implemented a decentralised model since the early 1990s with complementary responsibilities allocated to the central and regional levels of government (Ferr\u00e8 et al., 2014). The central government is respon- sible to set the overall funding requirements, goals and priorities of the SSN, mainly through the setting of \u2018Essential Levels of Care\u2019 (Livelli Essenziali di Assistenza, LEA) and by ensuring that the health expenditure of each region does not exceed the allocated budget. Nineteen regions and two autonomous provinces are responsible for the organisation and delivery of health care services \u2013 primary and secondary care, public health and social care \u2013 within their territories. They are allowed to do so with a high degree of administrative, political and also fiscal autonomy, e.g. regions can levy additional taxes to finance health care. This decentralised model has basically led to the development of 21 different regional/provincial health care sub-systems in Italy, with significant differences in terms of organisational and governance models (Nuti et al., 2016). Over the last two decades the Italian SSN has experienced continuous financial cuts, which while guaranteeing financial sustainability, might have led to a number of negative and unin- tended effects. A cap to personnel costs in 2004, for example, led to a depletion of health care professionals\u2019 competencies (Noto et al., 2020). The 2007 bail-out plans in some regions resulted in the downsizing of hospital capacity, block of staff turnover and new co-payments on pharma- ceutical expenditure (Bordignon and Turati, 2009; Piacenza and Turati, 2014). All of the above led to the realisation that more resources needed to be injected in the SSN, as recognised in the last national health plan \u2018Patto per la salute 2019\u20132021\u2019, issued in December 2019, just before the COVID-19 crisis (Ministero della Salute, 2019).", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9998979568, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -2.534031868}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 2, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_2_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [148.0, 1523.0, 1235.0, 1816.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Figure", "Equation label", "Abstract", "Table Note", "Page Header", "Reference text", "Section Header", "Other", "Table", "Table Caption", "Equation"], "scores": [-0.5289177895, -7.869079113, -8.2441587448, -8.6728668213, -9.4549913406, -9.8403692245, -10.1246500015, -10.2995491028, -10.6125392914, -12.1378097534, -12.2589130402, -14.6929550171, -15.185295105, -16.7182941437], "content": "3. National plan for preparation and response to an influenza pandemic By the impact observed in the early stage of the emergency, it is plausible to believe that the pan- demic caught the population, the local and national governments and even the international organisations and public health experts largely unprepared.

The general objective of the plan was to strengthen preparedness for an epidemiological emergency at the national and local levels, and more specifically to (i) quickly identify, confirm and describe cases of influenza caused by new viral subtypes, in order to promptly recognise the onset of the pandemic; (ii) minimise the risk of transmission and limit morbidity and mortality due to the pandemic; (iii) reduce the impact of the pandemic on health and social services and ensure the maintenance of essential services; (iv) ensure adequate training of personnel involved in the response to the pandemic; (v) ensure up-to-date and timely information for decision makers, health professionals, the media and the public and (vi) monitor the efficiency of the interventions undertaken. However, the plan was never revised in the 14 years since its development. This attracted strong criticisms, as reported also in the media (Puente, 2020). A number of key intermediate steps were envisaged to achieve these objectives, which, as unfortunately reported during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (de Maria; Palladino, 2020), remained largely unfulfilled. Even the Italian Prime Minister, on 24th February, threatened to take back powers from the regions and autonomous provinces because they were \u2018in charge of implementing healthcare but not prepared to face a national emergency\u2019 and complained about the lack of application of \u2018unspecified\u2019 preparedness protocols (Carinci, 2020). This gap does not come unexpected when considering that since 2001 in the allocation of the national health care budget no more than 5% was earmarked for prevention, which also includes the pandemic pre- paredness activities, with community and hospital care (51 and 44%, respectively in 2019) gaining the lion share (CERGAS Bocconi, 2019). More recently the Ministry of Health developed a new National Preparedness Plan (PanFlu 2021\u20132023), which identifies all the necessary actions that ought to be followed to avoid the health care system being overwhelmed again (Ministero della Salute, 2021). It also includes the possible responses to be taken in the event of a future epidemic, such as appropriate chain of commands, prevention and control measures. Furthermore, the new plan includes an explicit monitoring function of the implementation of the plan itself (Fassari, 2021).", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9998842478, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": 0.8863480091}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 3, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_3_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [116.0, 1105.0, 1206.0, 1816.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Equation label", "Reference text", "Abstract", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Section Header", "Page Header", "Figure", "Table Note", "Other", "Equation", "Table", "Table Caption"], "scores": [2.1528141499, -14.8326778412, -16.2141304016, -17.4537525177, -17.535905838, -18.0314006805, -18.4196510315, -19.0120944977, -19.4934577942, -20.6833763123, -23.6867618561, -28.4834499359, -28.6178627014, -29.57213974], "content": "4. Governing the emergency: who? when? how? why? On 31st January 2020, the Italian Government declared a national emergency in order to be able to face the incoming COVID-19 crisis. The most direct consequence of this act was that the Department of Civil Protection, an operative branch of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, took up the important role of coordination and execution of the emergency interven- tion. The Civil Protection is a highly regarded and reputable organisation, a reputation matured through their long experience with dealing with earthquakes and other national disasters. Additional committees and roles were also created to front the emergency. In particular and following the timeline of events, on 3rd February, the Civil Protection Department set up a tech- nical and scientific committee (hereafter CTS), comprising of high level civil servants from within the Ministry of Health, the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (National Institute of Health, ISS), regional governments and the same Civil Protection Department, as well as clinical experts (public health experts, virologists and clinicians) to provide scientific advice to the government. The regional governments of Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Piedmont, all at the epicentre of the COVID-19 health crisis in Italy, also set up their own task forces and advisory committees. Furthermore, on 17th March, to respond to the inadequate availability of both personal protec- tion equipment (PPE) and ventilators, the Prime Minister appointed a commissioner in charge of coordinating their centralised procurement.

National and regional policy responses The first Italian COVID-19 positive patient was reported by the local health authorities in Lombardy in Codogno (Lodi) on 20th February, followed by a number of additional cases in the neighbouring areas of Emilia-Romagna and Veneto. On 21st February, the first COVID-19 death was recorded in Veneto. On 23rd February, the government reacted by introducing the first movement and access/exit restrictions around these hotspots, known as \u2018red zones\u2019. Additional restrictive measures for the whole of Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Liguria and Piedmont followed on 25th February. Nationwide closure of schools and universities was declared on 4th March, with additional social distancing measures introduced on 9th March. A national partial lockdown was enforced on 11th March, affecting bars, restaurants and recreational facilities, and culminating in the complete lockdown on 22nd March. Further restrictions to people\u2019s movements were introduced on 25th March, except for essential reasons (e.g. work, health and getting supplies). Phase 1 of the Italian response to the emergency ended on 3rd May. This was followed by phase 2 (4th May to 2nd June) during which most primary and secondary productive sectors, professionals and private health care clinics and most retail shops, businesses and customer services, resumed activities subject to sector-specific COVID-19 safety protocols (DPCM, 2020b). Previous restrictions to the free movement of citizens were lifted, within one\u2019s region of residence only. Further regulations, relaxing the existing lockdown measures, were adopted nationwide and locally on 17th May (DPCM, 2020a). At this stage, a key role was played by the Italian regions, which asked and obtained the right to set specific regional guidelines (de Belvis et al., 2020). As of 3rd June, all businesses reopened subject to aforementioned protocols and social distan- cing rules. Free inter-regional movement of citizens was also reinstated, albeit with restrictions on foreign travel. The wearing of face-masks (for \u2a7e6 years) outdoors, on public transport, in shop/ businesses became mandatory as well as keeping at least 1 m distance. Schools and universities remained closed, but provided lessons through distance learning platforms (didattica a distanza) and reopened only in September 2020 in a staggered way. The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 has unevenly affected Italian regions, with a clear north-south gradient. These differences are mainly due to multiple independent entries of the virus in nor- thern Italy, but may also be linked to the diverse set of policies implemented at the regional level. In a companion paper, we discuss the differences and similarities of the Italian regional pol- icy responses to COVID-19. Similarly to many European countries and the USA, nursing homes (Residenza Sanitaria Assistenziale, RSA) in Italy were particularly hit by the COVID-19 outburst (Berloto et al., 2020; Ravizza, 2020). The excess mortality recorded in these settings seems to have followed the regional pattern of exposure to and incidence of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. These excess deaths, flagged up by a newspaper investigation, prompted the ISS to conduct a targeted survey, which revealed that an average of 9.1% of all nursing homes\u2019 residents died in Italy, with a peak of", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999703169, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -0.276499927}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 4, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_4_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [22.0, 1868.0, 738.0, 1884.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Figure", "Page Header", "Equation label", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Equation", "Table", "Other", "Abstract", "Section Header", "Table Caption"], "scores": [-2.4380877018, -2.7295129299, -5.2044692039, -5.3970050812, -5.6565933228, -5.7757616043, -6.9413022995, -7.8480610847, -8.1804847717, -8.2420024872, -8.9378728867, -9.3167562485, -9.63671875, -10.371055603], "content": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S1744133121000141 Published online by Cambridge University Press", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9998701811, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -2.4380877018}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 5, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_5_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [778.0, 98.0, 1203.0, 123.0], "classes": ["Page Header", "Page Footer", "Section Header", "Figure Caption", "Equation label", "Body Text", "Other", "Equation", "Reference text", "Table Caption", "Figure", "Table", "Table Note", "Abstract"], "scores": [-1.3458557129, -4.1587495804, -4.5718159676, -5.8819756508, -6.4825782776, -7.077296257, -7.0920491219, -7.4075374603, -7.644446373, -8.2835216522, -8.3458108902, -9.0537319183, -9.7221946716, -10.96829319], "content": "Health Economics, Policy and Law 5", "postprocess_cls": "Page Header", "postprocess_score": 0.9999748468, "detect_cls": "Page Header", "detect_score": -1.3458557129}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 5, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_5_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [117.0, 178.0, 1204.0, 301.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Reference text", "Page Footer", "Equation label", "Table Note", "Abstract", "Other", "Page Header", "Figure", "Section Header", "Figure Caption", "Table", "Table Caption", "Equation"], "scores": [-1.5351964235, -2.9488465786, -3.7890331745, -4.5399165154, -5.1430034637, -5.7203850746, -6.7691788673, -7.4291009903, -7.5888442993, -7.9254670143, -8.7931890488, -8.8383350372, -10.1246385574, -10.6597270966], "content": "14% in Lombardy, between 1st February and 14th April, of which about 37.4% officially due to COVID-19 (Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0, 2020).

This has meant also increasing working hours and length of shifts for medical and nursing staff on duty. The emergency magnified, therefore, all the negative consequences of the extensive underfunding of the Italian health care system and of the stop in workforce turnover. Italy, as many other OECD countries, had been suffering from both work- force shortages in the health care sector (CERGAS Bocconi, 2019) and an ageing medical work- force (OECD, 2019) for some time. According to the OECD Health at a Glance Indicators (OECD, 2019), in 2017 Italy had the largest share (55 vs 34% OECD average) of medical doctors aged 55 and over among all OECD countries \u2013 a share which increased by 36% between 2000 and 2017. However, the issue of workforce shortages is especially true in the case of nurses. Italy has in fact fewer nurses than nearly all western European countries (excluding Spain), with 5.8 nurses per 1000 population compared to the European average of 8.5. And while Italy fares better com- pared to their European peers in terms of medical professionals (4.0 doctors per 1000 population compared with the EU average of 3.6), Italy has the lowest doctor-to-nurse ratio in the OECD (1.4 nurses per doctor) (OECD/European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, 2019). Despite recent attempts by the Italian government to address this imbalance through increasing the num- ber of students training to become nurse (the number increased to 13,000 in 2014 from a low 3100), the COVID-19 crisis has heightened the shortage of health care professionals suffered by the SSN, with a pre-COVID-19 incidence of medical personnel of about 95 workers per 10,000 inhabitants (57 nurses, 19 doctors and 19 other technical staff). The shortage of nurses and medical doctors front lining the emergency response, also in light of the high number of nurses and medical professionals testing positive to COVID-19 (Bellizzi et al., 2020), forced the Government to introduce several measures (DL, 2020a, 2020b; DPCM, 2020b) in order to face the rapidly rising demand of extra medical and other health care person- nel. These measures included inter-regional redistribution of health care personnel, the re-hiring of retired medics, nurses and other health care professionals, the creation of faster recruitment tracks, the possibility to employ personnel on a freelance basis, the hiring of 20,000 health care professionals (3.5% growth in the health workforce): the new hires comprised of more than 4300 additional medical doctors, mainly anaesthesiologists; around 9700 nurses; and 6000 other health care professionals, mainly technical personnel (Aimone Gigio et al., 2020). Further measures included the allocation of 250 million EUR to pay for staff overtime, the pos- sibility for health care facilities to postpone retirement for eligible staff, the possibility for retired doctors and nurses to return to practice on a voluntary basis (in the peak of the crisis in", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9997808337, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -0.2122107744}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 7, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_7_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [22.0, 1868.0, 738.0, 1884.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Figure", "Page Header", "Equation label", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Equation", "Table", "Other", "Abstract", "Section Header", "Table Caption"], "scores": [-2.4380877018, -2.7295129299, -5.2044692039, -5.3970050812, -5.6565933228, -5.7757616043, -6.9413022995, -7.8480610847, -8.1804847717, -8.2420024872, -8.9378728867, -9.3167562485, -9.63671875, -10.371055603], "content": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S1744133121000141 Published online by Cambridge University Press", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9998701811, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -2.4380877018}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 8, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_8_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [148.0, 98.0, 363.0, 117.0], "classes": ["Equation label", "Reference text", "Table", "Table Caption", "Figure Caption", "Figure", "Page Header", "Section Header", "Body Text", "Page Footer", "Table Note", "Equation", "Abstract", "Other"], "scores": [-1.291493535, -1.4530946016, -2.1109330654, -2.4030478001, -2.5346112251, -2.5728371143, -2.5870149136, -2.6401190758, -2.6894919872, -2.8575749397, -2.8650093079, -2.8655922413, -3.091438055, -3.0957467556], "content": "8 Iris Bosa et al.", "postprocess_cls": "Page Header", "postprocess_score": 0.999080658, "detect_cls": "Equation label", "detect_score": -1.291493535}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 8, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_8_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [148.0, 178.0, 1235.0, 334.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Page Footer", "Abstract", "Table Note", "Figure Caption", "Reference text", "Other", "Equation label", "Section Header", "Figure", "Page Header", "Table Caption", "Table", "Equation"], "scores": [-2.786860466, -5.21504879, -5.8140420914, -6.692211628, -6.9964332581, -7.9135255814, -8.6611461639, -8.7955760956, -9.5158777237, -9.5379428864, -10.715801239, -11.1166973114, -12.3555860519, -14.8787212372], "content": "Lombardy, more than 300 retired doctors and 500 retired nurses returned to practice on a vol- untary basis), and to request the temporary enrolment of doctors and nurses from the armed forces.

This lead to a forced acceleration in the adoption of telemedicine, e-prescribing and similar practices. In Italy, especially for com- munity care services, many regions activated a number of alternative provisions of health care, such as teleconsultations, over a very short period of time. Telemedicine in Italy has been trad- itionally delivered using several applications, poorly interconnected and with inconsistent local and regional reimbursement practices. A temporary model to ease organisational aspects of the implementation of telemedicine services during the emergency was issued by the ISS, albeit without a specific national guidance on reimbursement codes, which caused the occurrence of inter-regional differences. At the start of the pandemic, telemedicine was not explicitly covered in the guaranteed LEA. Although private telemonitoring service providers reported a marked increase in the use of direct-to-consumer services, the lack of a framework to reimburse telemedi- cine services hindered wider-scale adoption by many public institutions (Petracca et al., 2020). The COVID-19 crisis boosted the digitisation process in Italy, thanks to a relaxation of usual red tapes (General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), procurement rules and organisational resistance) in two ways. First, it helped revitalise dormant innovations, like e-prescription and telemedicine already in place (Oliveira Hashiguchi, 2020), given the urgency of offering alterna- tive ways to care for patients. This forced many previously reluctant or late \u2018bloomer\u2019 profes- sionals to swiftly rely on telemedicine. Second, it led to further investments in technological infrastructure necessary to tackle the challenges posed by the outbreak, such as the introduction of mobile apps for controlling contact tracing or social distancing (Kummitha, 2020). The Immuni app was introduced as a surveillance system, albeit not compulsory, in June 2020. Two months later, only 4 million Italians (about 6% of the total population) had downloaded it, against the minimum required threshold of 12 million (equivalent to 20% of total population downloads or 60% of actual users) to guarantee its real effectiveness (Berra, 2020; Ferretti et al., 2020). The most recent estimates report over 10 million downloads of the Immuni app since its launch (Immuni Italia, 2020).", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9926568866, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -1.2808414698}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 8, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_8_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [149.0, 1396.0, 505.0, 1415.0], "classes": ["Figure", "Page Footer", "Table", "Body Text", "Page Header", "Other", "Section Header", "Table Caption", "Equation", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Equation label", "Reference text", "Abstract"], "scores": [-3.6776747704, -5.794989109, -7.5388092995, -8.1194076538, -8.7869987488, -9.6042108536, -9.9146595001, -10.1745433807, -10.17491436, -10.8501329422, -11.3014593124, -11.3034362793, -12.5137281418, -12.8350896835], "content": "6.2 Demand-side considerations", "postprocess_cls": "Section Header", "postprocess_score": 0.995718658, "detect_cls": "Figure", "detect_score": -3.6776747704}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 8, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_8_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [148.0, 1434.0, 1238.0, 1816.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Abstract", "Figure", "Other", "Table Note", "Page Footer", "Figure Caption", "Table", "Reference text", "Page Header", "Table Caption", "Section Header", "Equation label", "Equation"], "scores": [-4.7434592247, -9.2857341766, -11.1891059875, -11.5815553665, -11.9053583145, -11.9152832031, -13.5763597488, -14.1682739258, -14.7561826706, -15.2401437759, -15.8592796326, -16.8071422577, -17.3146648407, -21.2913227081], "content": "The surge of COVID-19 patients who required medical care, and specifically intensive care, has led almost everywhere to a rapid and extensive reprogramming of health care service delivery (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020).

Answering this question is neither simple nor straightforward. Italy was the first EU country to be hit by the COVID-19 epidemic. The initial response from both the Italian national and regional governments, business organisations, as well as that the general public was one of disbelief and inaction. However, the declaration of an emergency state early on in the crisis enabled the national government to take immediate and executive deci- sions to tackle the health crisis. In this midst, the decision to impose strict lockdown measures, similar to those imposed by China, was a difficult exercise as it required dealing with the unpre- cedented trade-off between enforcing measures that impinge on individual liberties in a demo- cratic system, and the need to contain, or at least mitigate, the spread of the virus. Delays in the enforcement of lockdown measures, especially in closing non-essential production activities, ensued because of the need to acquire the consensus of both business industry and union repre- sentatives (Bosa et al., 2020). Moreover, the early phase of the emergency was characterised by low level of compliance with and adherence to public health measures. An example of it is the mass flow of people who trav- elled from the hardest hit northern regions towards the south, before the introduction of the national lockdown in March, after this policy was prematurely leaked to the press, and which may potentially have had a negative impact on the spread of the outbreak in previously unaffected areas (Bosa et al., 2020). However, most southern regions took immediate steps to deal with the flux of people coming from the northern regions, by for example introducing a 14 day self- isolation period for people travelling from the hardest hit regions. This may have allowed these regions to keep their initial numbers of positive COVID-19 cases low(er) and to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 earlier than northern regions (Bosa et al., 2020). The second wave of the pandemic is not sparing southern regions, revealing pre-existing weaknesses in their models of health care organisation and delivery. Italy\u2019s multi-level governance structure and its decentralised health care system have allowed local governments (both regional and municipalities) to tailor their responses to the needs of their population and to proactively adopt further measures as required by the epidemiological development of the COVID-19 outbreak in their respective areas. However, we think that \u2018this pluralism might have impeded faster and more integrated responses, and may have fuelled inter- governmental tensions\u2019 (Bosa et al., 2020).

This proved to be suboptimal, as revealed by the high incidence and high rate at which the virus spread, and the subsequent high need for ventilators and intensive care beds. Italy appeared to be under-equipped with respect to both, which has been suggested to have put the country under great(er) risk during this crisis. A study by Remuzzi and Remuzzi (2020), for example, esti- mated that by 29th March between 9 and 11% of COVID-19 patients required ICU care. Given the number of COVID-19 cases was at the time equal to 73,800, the authors stated that around 7380 ICU beds were needed, a number well exceeding the ICU bed capacity at the time. This may have forced ICU specialists to prioritise patients more likely to benefit and survive. Furthermore, in the urgency of addressing COVID-19 patients in a hospital setting (with the doubling of ICU beds in the span of a mere 15 days), the national and regional governments might have been slow in organising an equally effective response at the primary/community care level. The high level of infected general practitioners (as compared to all health care profes- sionals) testifies the lower level of attention that this part of the health care system received in the overall COVID-19 emergency response strategy (FNOMCeO, 2020). However early on in the pandemic (March 2020), the central government required the creation of special units (Unit\u00e0 Speciali di Continuit\u00e0 Assistenziale, USCA, 1 every 50,000 inhabitants) to manage COVID-19 patients, who did not require hospital care, to be followed in the community, including the monitoring of people in home-isolation (DL, 2020a, 2020b). However, their intro- duction by the single regions has not been uniform with a minimum of five USCAs activated in Molise and PA Bolzen against the maximum number of 250 USCAs in Lazio. Lombardy, the region that has historically invested the least on primary/community care, has only activated 157 USCAs against the scheduled 202 (Fassari, 2020). Another important issue \u2013 raising questions on the appropriateness and the timing of the containment measures implemented in Italy, and especially in the Lombardy region \u2013 is in the number of deaths in nursing homes. In Lombardy, for example, to ease pressure on hospi- tals already working at full capacity, regional decision makers proposed to use RSA beds to treat non-critical COVID-19 patients, provided that these patients could be properly isolated (Lombardy Region, 2020). At the time of writing, these decisions are under judicial investiga- tions to establish whether they have contributed to the excess deaths observed in nursing homes in Lombardy (Serra, 2020). Furthermore, RSA\u2019s staff and carers have suffered from massive shortage of PPE, similarly to other countries (Berloto et al., 2020), and from a widespread lack of appropriate training. Finally, the COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the need to review the way social care is organised and delivered in Italy, and the need for a regulatory body responsible for controlling the quality of services provided by RSAs, which does not currently exist (Ravizza, 2020). Disruption or deliberate delays in seeking needed care may have raised concerns, anxiety, fear and may have negatively impacted the mental health of patients, especially those in vulnerable and fragile groups (Citoni et al., 2020). A silent sub-epidemic of people who needed hospital care but did not dare to show up may well rival the carnage directly produced by COVID-19 \u2013 a collateral damage from delay of less urgent care that truly could not wait, with potentially thousands of missed diagnoses who will deteriorate or appear as late presentations or inoperable. The toll of unaddressed health problems is accompanied by a mounting backlog of procedures that could cost billions to the SSN and may require a substantial amount of extra health care workforce input to bring it under control (Rosenbaum, 2020). Finally, it still needs to be investigated what the effects on access to care and the quality of care provided by the move to digital health care provision are, given that not all types of patients nor all types of clinical conditions are amenable to be treated as such. Despite this unprecedented injection of digitalisation, there are still professionals and patients who still have to catch-up \u2013 an issue termed \u2018The Great Digital divide\u2019 \u2013 making it a priority to bring people who are \u2018digitally excluded online\u2019 (Capgemini Research Institute, 2020).", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9994302392, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -0.9281753898}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 10, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_10_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [22.0, 1868.0, 738.0, 1884.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Page Footer", "Reference text", "Figure", "Page Header", "Equation label", "Figure Caption", "Table Note", "Equation", "Table", "Other", "Abstract", "Section Header", "Table Caption"], "scores": [-2.4380877018, -2.7295129299, -5.2044692039, -5.3970050812, -5.6565933228, -5.7757616043, -6.9413022995, -7.8480610847, -8.1804847717, -8.2420024872, -8.9378728867, -9.3167562485, -9.63671875, -10.371055603], "content": "https://doi.org/10.1017/S1744133121000141 Published online by Cambridge University Press", "postprocess_cls": "Page Footer", "postprocess_score": 0.9998701811, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -2.4380877018}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 11, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_11_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [117.0, 178.0, 300.0, 199.0], "classes": ["Body Text", "Other", "Figure", "Section Header", "Figure Caption", "Page Footer", "Page Header", "Table Note", "Table", "Reference text", "Equation label", "Abstract", "Equation", "Table Caption"], "scores": [-5.0582132339, -5.4047412872, -7.1692504883, -7.7091546059, -10.3960161209, -10.7090864182, -10.8134374619, -11.9818468094, -12.5882930756, -13.4570121765, -14.0547418594, -14.1194391251, -14.1718873978, -14.3361930847], "content": "8.

Current government instructions are based on a three-tier regional risk assessment. At the time of writing, Italy was still experiencing a daily rise of COVID-19 cases and related deaths, which led to the re-introduction of movement restrictions, curfews and early daily clo- sures of businesses. When and how these restrictions will impact curbing and flattening the curve is a question that cannot be answered yet. The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the country after years of strict spending reviews and severe cost containment measures (at least since the 2008 economic crisis). These have cut down resources to the health system and hospital capacity, with said cost-containment measures shift- ing de facto the burden of health care finance from national and regional governments to house- holds (e.g. increasing user charges), and setting tighter budget constraints for pharmaceutical public expenditure, in a context of increasing socioeconomic inequalities in both health care use and financing (Citoni et al., 2020). In 2019, the Italian government started to redress the financing of the SSN, increasing its fund- ing to 114.5 billion EUR (+1.59% increase in nominal terms), with further forecasted increases of 2 billion EUR and 1.5 billion EUR for 2020 and 2021, respectively (Citoni et al., 2020; de Belvis et al., 2020). Moreover, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent eco- nomic crisis, the government approved a series of economic measures aimed at supporting several sectors of the Italian economy, including health care (de Belvis et al., 2020). The main upcoming challenges, besides adequate and sustainable funding of the SSN, for the Ministry of Health, the national government and the regions are how to reorganise the SSN, pos- sibly even in its governance; what priorities to set to provide and strengthen health care services (e.g. prevention/public health, primary/community care); how to overcome workforce shortages in the medium and long term, assuring the right mix of competences within the SSN; and how to modernise the physical infrastructures of the health care system; all the while keeping in mind, that reinforcing the country\u2019s preparedness to future epidemics can no longer be postponed.", "postprocess_cls": "Body Text", "postprocess_score": 0.9999819994, "detect_cls": "Body Text", "detect_score": -0.8346464634}, {"pdf_name": "response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf", "dataset_id": "documents_5Feb", "page_num": 11, "img_pth": "/mytmp/images/response-to-covid-19-was-italy-unprepared.pdf_11_pad", "pdf_dims": [0.0, 0.0, 493.228, 700.157], "bounding_box": [117.0, 1141.0, 365.0, 1157.0], "classes": ["Page Footer", "Body Text", "Other", "Figure", "Section Header", "Table Note", "Page Header", "Reference text", "Equation", "Figure Caption", "Equation label", "Table", "Abstract", "Table Caption"], "scores": [-4.9956507683, -7.1314110756, -8.1307821274, -9.980298996, -10.7912693024, -14.3150806427, -14.9856653214, -15.1540784836, -15.9525175095, -15.9712791443, -16.5582504272, -18.4255657196, -19.1646976471, -20.9115467072], "content": "Conflict of interest.
