This pattern is difficult to reconcile with a standard epidemic pattern for reasons that have to be analyzed.
Many hypotheses can be put forward to account for this observation.
Learning from a set of coronavirus mediated epidemics that affected pigs in the 1983 -1985 [1] we chose to explore here the consequences of  a situation where  two overlapping epidemics interfere with each other.
The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow.
It is based on the high mutation and  recombination rate of  coronaviruses [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple mutations [3].
There are two epidemics, one epidemic is SARS caused by  a coronavirus virus, call it virus A. Another epidemic, which may have appeared before SARS, is assumed to be extremely contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innocuousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces.
It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B.
The most likely is that it would cause gastroenteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had diarrhoea for about one day, during this winter in Guangdong and in Hong Kong).
The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recombination event from virus B [4-6].
We also explore the possible situation where  viruses A and  B would be of totally different origin, but would cause an overlapping immune response of  the host.
Both epidemics would spread in parallel, and  it can be expected that the epidemic caused by virus B which is rather innocuous, protects against SARS (so that naive regions, not protected by the epidemic B can get SARS large outbreaks).
Various consequences of the spreading pattern of this double epidemic hypothesis are discussed in relation with the puzzling distribution of  the disease in Mainland China, noticeably, in the huge difference witnessed between the situation in Beijing and in Shanghai (both regions have tight and  frequent contacts with Guangdong and  Hong Kong).

The hypothesis of the double epidemic model for SARS we develop here is as follow.
It is based on the high mutation and  recombination rate of  coronaviruses [2], and on the observation that tissue tropism can be changed by  simple mutations [3].
There are two epidemics, one epidemic is SARS caused by  a coronavirus virus, call it virus A. Another epidemic, which may have appeared before SARS, is assumed to be extremely contagious because of the nature of the virus and of its relative innocuousness, could be propagated by contaminated food and soiled surfaces.
It could be caused by some coronavirus, call it virus B.
The most likely is that it would cause gastroenteritis (this fits with the observation that many people had diarrhoea for about one day, during this winter in Guangdong and in Hong Kong).
The most likely origin of virus A is a more or less complicated mutation or recombination event from virus B [4-6].
We also explore the possible situation where  viruses A and  B would be of totally different origin, but would cause an overlapping immune response of  the host.

This sensitivity in the parameters can therefore give rise to unacceptable errors in predicting the size of the epidemic and invalidates thus the model.
Contrariwise, when we try to fit the data with respect to a hypothetical much smaller population, the sensitivity decreases.
Therefore, we are lead to consider a model for which the effective population, i.e. the total population that enters the susceptible class is, for some yet to define reason, much less than the total population.
In other words, a large portion of the total population is protected during the epidemic.
Note that this happens when a population undergoes vaccination against a disease, i.e. some people become not only immune to the epidemic but do not transmit it neither.
It is also possible that the vaccination against another disease can protect people from being infected by SARS.
Another possibility is that a different, but similar, disease that spread before (or is spreading simultaneously with SARS) has immunized some of the population against SARS; this is our working hypothesis because it fits better with the relatively surprising SARS propagation which is less severe in places with low hygiene conditions.

It is worth stressing that we did not explore the intricacies of  the mathematical solutions of  this new epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics.
The central reason for our approach is that the more parameters introduced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the movement of planets in the Ptolemean system).
Because data may be inaccurate (and at the time of  writing this is a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out.
This is convenient in a continuous model represented by  a set of  simple differential equations.
A drawback of  this approach appears when the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involving stochastic parameters would be more adapted.
However this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve.
A second constraint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior of  the epidemic is so complex that it would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.
We tried to overcome these difficulties by restricting as much as possible the number of  fitting parameters in the model.
Furthermore we checked that the parameters we introduced were consistent with a purely phenomenological description of  the disease.
In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statistics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 10.12 days.
On the other hand, the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios.
With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Beijing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be represented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the size of  the epidemic - with only 2 or 3 new cases for some days - is too small when compared with the total population of  over 80 millions : in this case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the differential model is not relevant for this setting).
Furthermore we could use the set of parameters measured from the past unfolding of the epidemic, to construct scenarios for its future trends and monitor the impact of political decisions to control its spread and development.",249

It is worth stressing that we did not explore the intricacies of  the mathematical solutions of  this new epidemiological model, but, rather, tried to test with very crude hypotheses whether a new mode of transmission might not account for surprising aspects of some epidemics.
The central reason for our approach is that the more parameters introduced, the easier it is to represent any type of reality (this was the basis of the epicycle representation of the movement of planets in the Ptolemean system).
Because data may be inaccurate (and at the time of  writing this is a major concern for the WHO authorities) it is convenient to smooth them out.
This is convenient in a continuous model represented by  a set of  simple differential equations.
A drawback of  this approach appears when the number of cases becomes small: a discrete model involving stochastic parameters would be more adapted.
However this would probably require even more accuracy in the data, a feat that is impossible to achieve.
A second constraint introduced by inaccuracy in the data set is that the behavior of  the epidemic is so complex that it would require many parameters to be represented, implying, in fact that a very large set of causes would account for the observations.
We tried to overcome these difficulties by restricting as much as possible the number of  fitting parameters in the model.
Furthermore we checked that the parameters we introduced were consistent with a purely phenomenological description of  the disease.
In fact, from the work of Donnelly C. et al. [18] on the statistics about the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 10.12 days.
On the other hand, the incubation period plus the time from onset to admission is about 1/ a + 1/b days and from our parameters estimations on a and b, we find that 1/a + 1/b is about 11.8 and 11.4 for two different scenarios.
With these constraints we were able to simulate the epidemic at several places (Hong Kong, Beijing, Inner Mongolia) while other places failed to be represented faithfully (for instance for the Guangdong region where  the size of  the epidemic - with only 2 or 3 new cases for some days - is too small when compared with the total population of  over 80 millions : in this case either the data does not reflect the real situation or the differential model is not relevant for this setting).
